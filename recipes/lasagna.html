    <ul>
        <li>This recipe has simple ingredients but tons of flavor.</li>
        <li>creamy ricotta mixture</li>
        <li>savory meat sauce</li>
        <LI>Lots of mozzarella cheese. </LI>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    <ol>
        <li>Spoon meat sauce on the bottom of a lightly greased casserole dish. Add 4 boiled lasagna noodles (or use no-boil or fresh noodles). Spread 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture on top. Add 1.5 cups of meat sauce.

Repeat the same layers two more times.</li>
<li>Top with mozzarella cheese. Cover and bake at 375Â° for 30 minutes. Remove cover and bake for 15 more minutes. Broil at the end if desired. Let it rest for 15 minutes prior to serving with Garlic Bread With Cheese.</li>
    </ol>

    <ul>
        <li>Lasagna needs to have at least 3 layers in order to constitute a true lasagna. Most recipes have 3 or 4 layers.</li>
<li>I opted for 3 layers of 4 lasagna noodles as that is what will fit in a 9 x 13 inch casserole dish. Additional layers would require a deeper baking dish. </li>
    </ul>
